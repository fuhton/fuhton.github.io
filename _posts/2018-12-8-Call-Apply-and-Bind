title: Call, Apply, and Bind
---

Three things so similar it's hard to keep them apart. Been thinking how I'm not as familiar with `bind` as I should be, so diving in and realized I should extend it to `call`/`apply`.

### Call

`Function.prototype.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`
[MDN Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call)

Take the first argument as the context and then a list of arguments for the function. Essentially the same thing as `apply`, just with a list of arguments.

### Apply

`Function.prototype.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...])`
[MDN Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply)

Take the first argument as the context and then an array of arguments for the function. Essentially the same thing as `call`, just with an array of arguments.

### Bind

`function.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`
[MDN Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)

Given a defined function, provide the context and prepend the arguments when the function is invoked. Useful when you want to call a function later with a different context.
