title: Whats the best thing?
---

I've been building a UI that requires a lot of state management. To show this management, I've been relying on React (with the eventual expectation to use Redux for state). But, I think there could be a lot of reuse with this frontend code, beyond just React/Redux. Are Web Components a viable tool instead? Or should I not worry about this yet and stay lean? The startup mentality in me says stay lean, but I feel the need to get this right on the first pass. 

Obviously that's not gonna happen. Will just do React then migrate as needed...
